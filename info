*************************************

This mission-file is a modified version of the standard file of Altis Life RPG v3.1.4.8 which we downloaded from the hosting-service GitHub, Inc (c) , developed by Tonic and Itsyuka.
The Altis Life RPG Framework was also developed by Tonic, now it is being developed by Itsyuka.

All functions which you will find in this file (this may also include the serverside life-server file) are copyright by the owner itself - in this case Tonic and Itsyuka.
It might be, that some script-files (.SQF) of this mission may exactly look like another file.
This is definetly wrong. The scripting language "SQF (=Status Quo Function)" which was created by Bohemia Interactive Studio (c) has their own syntax.
So some syntax of a file may look like another ones code.
Also this mission-file contains self-made scripts that are using functions created by Tonic and Itsyuka.
Every file that contains a function which uses the prefix "life" or "TON" is a part of Tonic and Itsyukas Altis Life RPG Framework.
