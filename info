All functions you will find in this file (this may also include the serverside life-server file) are copyright by the owner itself - in this case Tonic and Itsyuka.
It might be, that some contents of files in this mission may exactly look like another file or just like 'copy-paste'.
This might be true, but it is definetly wrong that we copy-pasted anything into the Altis Life RPG v3.1.4.8.
The scripting language "SQF (=Status Quo Function)" which was created by Bohemia Interactive Studio (c) got their own syntax.

So some syntax of a file may look like another ones code.
Also this mission-file contains self-made scripts that are using functions created by Tonic and Itsyuka.
Every file that contains a function which uses the prefix "life" or "TON" is a part of Tonic and Itsyukas Altis Life RPG Framework.
